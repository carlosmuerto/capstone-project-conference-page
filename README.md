# Capstone Project - Conference Page

> In this capstone project I are going to build is based on an online website for a conference. MIcroverse provide some design guidelines for me to create the website, but I must personalize the content, i.e., instead of a conference you can build a website for a concert or for a web development course. It's very important the I personalize my project so that I have something unique in my portfolio to share with potential employers during job searching.
